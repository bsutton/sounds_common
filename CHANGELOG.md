Asserts were not being converted to disk on ios.
Fixed a bug where the mediaFormat was being ignored.
now throws an exception if the asset path is null.
removed the duration provider as its was simplier to just have each MediaFormat provide a getDuration method.
moved native media formats back into the sounds package to help with the implementatino of getDuration. The are also only usable in the sounds package because of the getDuration requirements.
exported duration_providers.
added equality operator.
Using the default codec (0) resulted in no recording so have moved back to aac.
renamed media formats to be of the form container/codec.
Replaced references to Codec with MediaFormat. Removed codec from MediaFormat as is not meaningful given the way audio mixes containers and codec in some nasty ways and often you can't define the two separately.
ignored .history
changed common to a nativemediaformat so it can be used to trigger recordings.
wip change from Codec to MediaFormat and extracting sounds_codec.
